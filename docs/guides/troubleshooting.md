# Troubleshooting

- Build fails with `root_source_file`/build API errors:
  - You are likely using an older Zig release. Switch to Zig `0.15.x`.
- `wt: command not found` after install:
  - Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`, then restart your shell.
- zsh/bash/fish/nushell integration does not change directory after `wt new`:
  - Run `type wt` and confirm `wt` is a shell function.
  - Re-run `source ~/.zshrc` (zsh), `source ~/.bashrc` (bash), `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish` (fish), or `source ~/.config/nushell/wt.nu` (nushell).
  - Confirm your startup file includes the relevant snippet for your shell (`eval "$(wt shell-init zsh|bash)"`, `wt shell-init fish | source`, or nushell `save` + `source`).
- Bare `wt` does not open picker in scripts/CI/non-interactive shells:
  - This is expected: shell wrappers run no-arg picker only in interactive sessions.
  - Non-interactive bare `wt` passes through to the real binary; use explicit commands for automation (`wt list`, `wt rm <branch>`, etc.).
- Nushell no-arg `wt` picker errors are missing or behavior differs between interactive terminals vs scripts/CI:
  - Interactive Nushell sessions route picker stderr to `/dev/tty` so prompt and validation messages remain visible while picker stdout is still captured.
  - If that redirection fails, Nushell falls back to stderr capture (`| complete`) and preserves the picker exit code in `$env.LAST_EXIT_CODE`.
  - Regenerate and re-source the wrapper after upgrades: `wt shell-init nu | save -f ~/.config/nushell/wt.nu` then `source ~/.config/nushell/wt.nu`.
- `wt rm --picker fzf` fails with picker unavailable:
  - Install `fzf`, or run `wt rm --picker builtin`.
- Unsure whether function or binary is running:
  - Run `type wt`.
  - If it says `wt is a function`, the wrapper is active.
  - If it says `wt is /.../wt`, you are calling the binary directly.
