# ADRs

This folder tracks Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for decisions that change behavior, UX, or technical direction.

## When to write an ADR

Create or propose an ADR when a change:

- introduces a new interaction model or workflow
- changes defaults or user-facing semantics
- adds cross-platform complexity or notable tradeoffs
- sets a policy likely to affect future features

## Naming

Use `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md`.

## Minimal template

```md
# ADR: <title>

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Decision Makers: <names/roles>

## Context
<problem and constraints>

## Decision
<what we chose>

## Consequences
<benefits, costs, risks>
