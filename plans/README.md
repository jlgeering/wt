# Plans

This folder is for active, work-in-progress planning documents only.

Use this area for design docs and implementation plans that still drive current work.

## Lifecycle

1. Create a plan in this folder when work is active.
2. Keep status and assumptions current while implementation is in progress.
3. Move completed or superseded plans to [`archive/plans/`](../archive/plans/README.md).

## Naming

Use `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-(design|plan).md`.
